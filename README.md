### Hi there, I'm Bruno 👋
- 🚀 I'm a Product Owner and Data Scientist based in Lima, Peru.
- 📈 I have been improving my Data Science and Machine Learning skills in the past few months, going from zero to implementing ML models for supervised learning.
- 🤓 I am very analytical and I tend to get very nerdy about the things I like. "Why does this work? How does this work? Is there a better way to do this?".
- ⛰️ I also like trekking, meeting new people, and traveling. When I am not on my computer, you can always find me on a mountain or exploring new places.
- 📫 You can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/corneliobruno/) for work 💼
